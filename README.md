## Compiling and running
- To compile, type `make` in your bash. The code should compile well under `gnu17` standard.
- To run, type in `./main` in your bash, and you will see the `mumsh $ `. After that, you can realize common commands in this simple mum shell.


## Brief documentation

This is a shell written in C and can support bash commands, functioning kind of like an ordinary shell (see the wiki page for details). The shell is still at a rather preliminary stage and still needs refinement for rather higher level of commands.
